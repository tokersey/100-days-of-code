# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the first 2 projects in Javascript30 and built a PHP function to tell if a string starts with an uppercase. 

**Thoughts** The JS30 tutorials are a great to learn new things in ES6 and now I have a drum kit and a functional clock. The PHP script was to test a regex, but it was fun to figure out the simplest way to accomplish the task.
